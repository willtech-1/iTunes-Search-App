### What is it ?
This iTunes App I built using iTunes Search API and ReactJS, user can search for whatever media type of content they want to search for,
from music to podcast and even music videos of their faviourite artists. Users can also create their own favourite playlist on the app.
The backend of the application handles the third-party API.
